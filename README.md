# Supply Chain Analytics üß†üì¶

This repository presents a set of exercises and mini-projects focused on solving foundational supply chain challenges through analytical modeling. As someone passionate about the intersection of data, operations, and strategic impact, this repository explores demand prediction, inventory management, and logistics solutions using analytics tools and techniques.


Each project models a critical component of the supply chain from procurement and distribution to inventory control and network design using tools like Python and Excel. These exercises reflect the analytical thinking and structured problem-solving I bring to data-driven consulting and engineering roles.

Here is the corrected "What‚Äôs Inside" section for the Supply Chain Analytics repository reflecting the actual folders and focus areas from the repo:

## üìÅ What‚Äôs Inside
| Folder                     | Focus Area                    | Description                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `01-forecasting-price-changes` | Price Change Forecasting       | Develops models to forecast product price changes over time using historical pricing data and relevant features. |
| `02-time-series-forecasting`     | Demand Forecasting             | Applies time series analysis techniques to predict future product demand, supporting supply planning decisions. |
| `03-pricing-analysis`            | Pricing Strategy & Analytics  | Analyzes pricing data to evaluate and optimize pricing strategies, including elasticity and competitive positioning. |
| `04-demand-unconstraining`       | Demand Estimation             | Implements methods to unconstrain and adjust observed sales data to estimate true demand in restricted environments better. |
| `05-inventory-and-capacity-planning` | Inventory & Capacity Planning | Models inventory levels and capacity requirements to balance service levels with operational costs and constraints. |

## üí° Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Business Optimization**: Applied operations research methods to improve procurement, inventory, and distribution decisions.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Used linear and integer programming techniques to represent business constraints and objectives.
- **Analytical Storytelling**: Interpreted model outputs in a business context to inform tactical and strategic decision-making.

## üîß Tools Used
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, PuLP, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Modeling & Optimization:** Open Solver (Excel) for modeling and scenario analysis, PuLP for linear/integer programming
- **Analysis Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (analysis, modeling, documentation)
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn

## üéØ Why This Matters

In today‚Äôs dynamic global markets, supply chains are more than cost centers; they‚Äôre strategic levers for growth, resilience, and sustainability. This work demonstrates my ability to dissect complex business systems, design scalable data models, and communicate insights in a way that drives action. As I continue to build expertise in data engineering and analytics consulting, I see opportunities to evolve these models into integrated, automated workflows that support smarter, real-time decisions across industries.
