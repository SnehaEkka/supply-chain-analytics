# Supply Chain Analytics üß†üì¶

This repository presents a set of exercises and mini-projects focused on solving foundational supply chain challenges through analytical modeling. As someone passionate about the intersection of data, operations, and strategic impact, this repository explores demand prediction, inventory management, and logistics solutions using analytics tools and techniques.


Each project models a critical component of the supply chain from procurement and distribution to inventory control and network design using tools like Python and Excel. These exercises reflect the analytical thinking and structured problem-solving I bring to data-driven consulting and engineering roles.

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

| Folder | Focus Area | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `EOQ-model` | Inventory Optimization | Uses the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model to minimize total inventory costs by balancing ordering and holding costs. |
| `Procurement-allocation-model` | Supplier Strategy | Formulates an optimization model for allocating purchases across suppliers while considering cost and capacity constraints. |
| `Distribution-model` | Logistics Planning | Solves a transportation problem to optimize product distribution from warehouses to demand centers at minimal cost. |
| `Inventory-control-policies` | Risk & Demand Uncertainty | Compares fixed-order and periodic-review inventory control policies under varying demand scenarios. |
| `Supply-chain-network-design` | Network Optimization | Designs an end-to-end supply chain network using mathematical programming to determine optimal facility locations and flows. |

## üí° Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Business Optimization**: Applied operations research methods to improve procurement, inventory, and distribution decisions.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Used linear and integer programming techniques to represent business constraints and objectives.
- **Analytical Storytelling**: Interpreted model outputs in a business context to inform tactical and strategic decision-making.

## üîß Tools Used
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, PuLP, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Modeling & Optimization:** Open Solver (Excel) for modeling and scenario analysis, PuLP for linear/integer programming
- **Analysis Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (analysis, modeling, documentation)
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn

## üéØ Why This Matters

In today‚Äôs dynamic global markets, supply chains are more than cost centers; they‚Äôre strategic levers for growth, resilience, and sustainability. This work demonstrates my ability to dissect complex business systems, design scalable data models, and communicate insights in a way that drives action. As I continue to build expertise in data engineering and analytics consulting, I see opportunities to evolve these models into integrated, automated workflows that support smarter, real-time decisions across industries.
